# The model is working, as seen from the sequence on the mztab file after predicting
# But the way the mass offset is calcualted is not working, need to fix this.
# But the way the predicted data is saved using ms_io.py is not working, need to fix this
# After, fixing the ms_io file do the inference again
# Do the inference for both the casonovo model and this model on the data given by Aivett
# Evaluate the model
